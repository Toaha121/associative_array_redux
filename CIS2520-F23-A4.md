# CIS 2520 F23 Assignment 4: Associative Arrays Redux

In the last assignment, we built an *associative array* that
was implemented using a *hash table*.

In this assignment we
will implement a different *associative array* using a *trie*
based implementation, but providing the same API for use that we
used for the *hash* based design.  We will then think about comparing
these implementations, considering which might be better under
what circumstances.

## Library based design

As in the last assignment, we are building a library.  In fact,
as the library has **exactly the same API** it is accompanied
by the same `aarray.h` header file as before, and you can link
either library to your code without even recompiling the object
files.

The library source is again in a subdirectory called `aalib` and the
library itself is created within a file called `libAAtrie.a`.
(The library was given a new name for this assignment to help
you distinguish it from the library from your old assignment.)

There are two different ways to link to a library using a C
compiler, and the `makefile` has been updated to use the second
of these options:

1) directly refer to the library file `libAAtrie.a` as a file to link,
	almost as though it were simply an object file (this is what
	the `makefile` for A3 does)
2) link to the library using its "library name", which is the portion
	of the `.a` file name in between "`lib`" and "`.a`" (in our case
	this is `AAtrie`).  To do this kind of linking, you simply name
	the library using its short name and a `-l` option in the *link
	stage* of compiling.  As our library is in the current directory
	instead of a system library directory, we also need to pass the
	flag `-L.` to the compiler at this time. For example, this
	line links the `a4aa` executable:

	```
	cc -g -Wall -Iaalib -I. -L. -o a4aa aa_mainline.o keyprint.o data-reader.o -lAAtrie
	```

Take a look at the `makefile` provided here and compare it to the one
provided for A3 and you will see the differences.  The command
`diff(1)` will show you differences between files, for example:
```
diff ../A3/makefile makefile
```

This means that you can test out the "mainline" code in A4 with the
hash table based library you build for A3 by simply copying the
`libAA.a` file from your A3 directory to the current directory and
relinking using it instead of `libAAtrie.a`.
This will be useful to you when comparing your implementation
of associating arrays using tries with your hash table implementation
from A3.



## The nuts and bolts

As in A3, the actual work for implementing the trie goes on within the
files in the `aalib` directory.

Here are the relevant files for the associative array library in
this project:

* `aarray.h` -- the same header file as last time, describing the
	API for the associative array with the least possible information
	for *information hiding*.  Whether or not the underlying implementation
	is a *trie* or *hashtable* is not visible from this file.
* `trie.h` -- a *trie-specific* API providing a simpler interface to
	the trie code.  As we don't need the various options for probing,
	hash algorithms, size, *etc* this is a pure trie interface API.
	(Obviously this header cannot be used with a hash-table implementation
	version of `libAA.a`)
* `aalib/trie_defs.h` -- a header file that fills in the missing pieces
	of the *trie* definition for use within the `aalib` library directory.
* `aalib/aawrapper.c` -- code wrapping up the *trie* implementation so
	that it can be used through the *associative array* interface.
	This is an example of the *programming pattern* called *wrapper*.
* `aalib/trie.c` -- tools provided for you to create and destroy
	the data structures used within the *trie*, and also to print out
	the contents of a working *trie*.
* `aalib/trie-insert.c` -- a stub implementation of several functions
	that you can use to implement the insertion into a *trie*
* `aalib/trie-query.c` -- a stub implementation of several functions
	that you can use to implement looking up values within a *trie*
* `aalib/trie-delete.c` -- a stub implementation of several functions
	that you can use to implement deleting values from a *trie*
* `aalib/trie-iterator.c` -- iterator code that will present each
	key found in turn to a supplied callback

## Your work

You are asked to complete the code in the files
`trie-insert.c`, `trie-query.c` and `trie-delete.c`.

Note that the *trie* interface provides a pointer for a `cost`
variable.  If this pointer is not `NULL`, the value it points
to should be incremented for each successive link that the *trie*
code has to traverse when performing insert, query and delete.

Pseudo-code for the trie is available in the course notes.


# User code testing

Three different testing "mainline" programs are provided for you:

* `a4aa` based on `aa_mainline.c` -- this program uses the associative
	array API and prints out both the reported cost and the actual
	clock time taken for processing a set of key/value pairs defined
	in the same data file format that we used for A3.  Separate times
	and costs are listed for insert, query, and delete.
* `a4trie` based on `trie_mainline.c` -- a companion program that
	provides the times and cost when using the *trie* interface directly,
	rather than through the *associative array wrapper*.
* `a4fasta` based on `fasta_mainline.c` -- a second companion program
	that uses the associative array API.  Instead of the key/value
	pair format files used in A3, this loads and stores FASTA records
	by ID, allowing you to examine how both the *hash* and *trie*
	code works with large files with large records.

Using these options will allow you to exercise your trie based
associative array to ensure that it works robustly, and to compare
it to the has table based implementation.



# Packaging and analysis

In the `README.md` file in this directory you will find a template
for a description of when a trie based implementation would be
appropriate, and when a hash base implementation would be best
for use as the back-end of an associative array.

Fill in this template providing advice regarding when to choose
each implementation.  Be concrete in identifying what criteria
should inform the decision and how the decision should be made.


# Focus of the grading

Important factors in the grading include (in decreasing order of importance):

* **building correctly** using `make(1)`
	* Code that does not build using `make(1)` **on the linux.socs machines** will get no marks for functionality
		* Be sure to **test your code thoroughly** 
		* Running `make clean` followed by `make` will ensure a complete rebuild

* providing **documentation** through a "`README.txt`" (or "`README.md`") file containing the following information:
	* Your name and student number
	* Any resource you used for assistance
	* The state of your implementation -- whether any functionality is missing or the assignment is complete
* clear and correct assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both
	tries and hashes presented in the `README.md`
* correctly loading and storing data using string and integer keys
* correctly querying values based on keys, including using your new hash algorithm
* correctly deleting values based on keys, including using your new hash algorithm
* having **no memory errors or leaks** when run using `valgrind(1)`
